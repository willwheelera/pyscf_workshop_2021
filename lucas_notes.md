#Did you ack the NSF grant number?
#I think the acknowledgement should be the ALCC

#Why does one want to do a QMC calculation.
#What is the trial function?
#Took a while explaining the code to do the calculation--but why are we showing that?
#I don't think most of your audience will know what the Slater-Jastrow wave function is.
Will people know what the python files are? Why does it help to have them listed?
#pyscf wasn't explained until a bit late
#Fixed node ground state?
#'loc' title is unnecessary, can do title=""
#Will people know that you can do PBCs?
Testing
Explain axes
Option for the flow:
#1) DMC is a "good deal" for doing electronic calculations.
#2) Show that the workflow for doing DMC is pretty complicated, and that it involves linking together several codes.
3) (?) Explain the objective of the SSI--a one-stop shop for advanced methods. Explain pyscf methods.
#4) Say that we are working on the DMC part.
#5) What will people care about? a) easy to use, b) easy to develop, c) gives accurate results.
#6) Show a): notebook? that's more visual than
#7) Regarding b) Case study: development of a new excited state method using QMC
#8) Regarding c) show the benzene results.
also you showed that we can apply the technique to 100's of electrons at least
so that's something to point out
